# What is Indexium?

(This project is not ready yet, it is currently under development)

**Indexium** is a high-performance, blazing-fast search engine written in Java, built upon the robust [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/) framework. Lucene also powers several other well-known search engines, such as [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) and [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/).

The primary goal of Indexium is to be **user-friendly and easy to use**. It is designed as a RESTful API, allowing for seamless integration with any project. Indexium provides efficient and accurate search capabilities with minimal setup.

This repository contains some code examples as well as a comprehensive guide to help you get started with Indexium and index your first documents.

Harness the power of Luceneâ€™s advanced indexing and querying features through a straightforward API that scales effortlessly with your needs. Enhance your project with Indexium to enable fast and precise search functionality, ensuring your users can find what they need swiftly and easily.
