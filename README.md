# What is Indexium?

**Indexium** is a blazing-fast, high-performance Java written search engine built on the robust and well-known [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/) framework.
Lucene is also at the heart of many other search engines, including [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) and [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/).


Indexium is designed as a RESTful API, which means it can seamlessly integrate with any project, providing efficient and accurate search capabilities with minimal setup.

Experience the power of Lucene's advanced indexing and querying in a user-friendly API that scales effortlessly with your needs. Easily add a search functionality to your project with Indexium, and let your users find what they need in no time.
